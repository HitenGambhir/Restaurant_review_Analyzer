Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes classification algorithm, the model analyzes a dataset of restaurant reviews and predicts the sentiment of new reviews.

Project Structure
Data Processing: The project utilizes the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv dataset to train the model.
Text Preprocessing: Reviews are cleaned and preprocessed using regular expressions, stemming, and removal of stopwords.
Feature Extraction: The Count Vectorizer is used to convert the text data into a numerical format that can be fed into the model.
Model Training: The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is used for classification.
Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.
Libraries Used
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
nltk: For natural language processing tasks, including stopword removal and stemming.
sklearn: For machine learning functions, including model training, testing, and evaluation.
Dataset
The dataset used is Restaurant_Reviews.tsv, which contains restaurant reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

Features
Text Cleaning: Reviews are processed to remove special characters and convert text to lowercase.
Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form using the Porter Stemmer.
Stopword Removal: Commonly used words that do not contribute to sentiment are removed.
Model Prediction: The model can predict the sentiment of new reviews.
Example Usage
Two examples of predictions are included in the code:

Positive Review: The input "The food was Amazing" is classified as positive.
Negative Review: The input "The food was terrible" is classified as negative.
